## Abstract
The purpose of this app is to help users find and keep track of upcoming and past trips. Aditionally, the user should be able to book a new trip by a selected duration, number of travelers, date of departure, and location.  The User will need a login  try "traveler1" and the number can be through 50, and the password is "travel".

## Setup

1. click this link -[Reid's Travel Tracker](https://github.com/rpoole444/Travel-Tracker)
2. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.    
5. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`.  This will update to the latest version of packages.  We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version.  If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.
